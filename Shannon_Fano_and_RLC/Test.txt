og through your mind back to the last time you stood still in front of supermarket shelves, squandering days on “scrutinizing” every option, merely to pick up the items larger in size (else tagged on other miscellaneous promotional deals). Everything must have gone wildly against original intentions, there we were, coming up with such a prosaic defense, "it is indeed a bargain, which appears only s-l-i-g-h-t-l-y more pricey".

And that was not the only time we ran ourselves into the cunning psychological trap - the so-called “decoy effect".

Findings from an experiment [1], wherein participants could opt for either a Cross (a renowned US pen brand), or some meagre hard cashes, only 36% of which went for the pen. Then added a pen brand of lower value; such a figure soared to 46%.

In a like manner, Dan Ariely, the author of the notorious “Predictably Irrational”, conducted another like-minded experiment on The Economist’s annual subscription [2]. Getting exposed to 3 miscellaneous options: (1) 59 per year for the web version, (2) 125 for the paper version, and (3) also 125 for both virtual and paper versions; a meagre amount of 16% the students picked the first, whilst the other 84% did fix on the third. On the whole, literally no participant favored the [half-hearted] second option. Bizarrely enough, as researchers did away with that half-heartedness; the “virtual” favor violently surged to 68%, forasmuch as the "website plus free paper version" were loathed, thus sucking in the modest rest 32%.

After all, these studies proposed that the emergence of “impertinent third options” might distort consumers’ former “binary” purchasing patterns. Upon having the American Management Association (AMA) inquire himself of which, Dan even asserted: “… you can actually introduce products into the market that nobody chooses but nevertheless have effect on what people end up getting” [3].

The very introduction of “decoy" products, besides catalyzing the upselling of “non-decoy” products, even “normalize” others in the vicinity. To put into perspective, we must have found every 79,000-cinema-sized-popcorn box (let alone other extravagant soft drinks and snacks) “well-adjusted” upon heeding another 59,000 half-sized box. After all, were they exposed to either of which alone box of popcorn, people would turn to “conventional” popcorn price, thereafter loathing at, or shying away from buying which.

At this point, you must be jogging your memory through million times you squandered "trivial sums" on upsiding bubble tea cups, else opting for some “combos” to "pinch pennies", reassuring yourselves that those must have been either some “outstanding moves" or some handsome bargains. Dismally enough, each of which, however, must have been cunningly schemed beforehand.

Worse still, that was not the only "hoax" you did run yourselves into.

1 / Mind-maneuvered-magic-tricks...

Never scientists, every salesman and marketer still are capable of maneuvering consumer patterns. Let alone the aforementioned "decoys", they, to all appearances, are also the very “masterminds”, who own every other machiavellian psychological trick.

Priming, which prevails as an ubiquitous technique among psychologists, rules that exposure to certain concepts may distort the very way you heed other relevant events [4]. To demonstrate, getting one beforehand exposed to the term "doctor" would convert “nurse” into a comprehensible word, instead of coercing him to lay “nurse” on line with “bread”.

A 2002 study [5] zeroed in whether website designs could exert any impact on “car-oriented” visitors’ behaviors. After all, the findings suggested that were the background green-colored and gussied up with coins, the visitors would squander time on scrutinizing prices; whilst another flame-like background urged them to meticulously study safety information. They, thus, further proposed that every precondition or background context might distort the way people perceive, puzzle over, or act upon certain events.

Prevailing in sales, the so-called anchoring effect feasts on the very human mentality of getting driven by the first pieces of information we are given. To demonstrate [6], a shelf, once labeled as "Snicker Candy - buy 18 for your refrigerator", evidenced an upsurge by 38% over its former motto "Snicker candy - buy them for your refrigerator". The specific 18, to all appearances, was more of an incentive than a lame "them" (which appear all too equal to 0, for the most part).

Laying on the line, inquiring yourselves of whether you would laud a lame 5$ wine bottle; were it to arrive with a 45 USD tag? To the best of my knowledge, the answer would be “yup" [7]. In a study, Stanford Wine Club members were introduced to 5 different wine bottles of wine to spell out how those tasted. That said, only 3 of which were actually peculiar, inasmuch as two of which, in turn, were poured in two bottles only.

At first glance, they hemmed and hawed purely in price tags - howbeit tagged as either 5 USD or 45 USD, they were de facto 5$ bottles. That said, what expensive bottles bore with, however, were higher extolled than their “low-key counterparts”. Strikingly enough, upon sampling these respondents on another experiment wherein price tags were rubbed out, the “virtuosos” even rated the most catchpenny wine as the most “favorable”.

Again, lay yourselves bare at whether you did strive to cook up some "illusory superior" reasons to stave off the shame of splurging on some pricey items? Stay as frankly as the wine club gentlemen, who fiercely insisted that they must have tasted five different wines.

After all, should you own the very habit of painstakingly recording your shopping expenses, spare some time scrutinizing whether you are a victim of Illusion of Scarcity [8], loss aversion (Endowment Effect) [9], or (Reciprocity) [10].

You, in all likelihood, can never be certain of whether you were a “wise consumer", even if your “wise” decisions were driven by other people's product reviews and feedback [11]. Every of which, after all, is purely "social proof" [12] on which we model our actions on - an early diagnosis of crowd psychology.

The examples and studies above show the fact that in many cases, we think irrationally and human behavior is very susceptible to cognitive bias. Upon opting for expense decisions, we can hardly reasonably explain the motivation lies in our shopping behaviors [13]. Unfortunately, the sales and marketers know all too well about those Achilles heels of ours.

2. ... and the appalling upward slope of Behavioral Economics.

Going wildly against classical economists’ homo oeconomicus model - which theorizes that humans stand out in the economy as rational individuals feasting on a pert-near information processing system, tilted towards optimizing our benefits; behavioral economists home in a peculiar depiction of which. Accordingly, either will, rationality, or even self-interest, are actually in-between superficial cognitive boundaries, which govern our decisions and choices, albeit every so often threatening our own human interests.

Such characteristics did even prevail in Richard Thaler’s The Push - the 2017 Economics Nobel Prize winner [14]. Such a sublime achievement has stirred up his colleagues’ perception on behavioral economics, even leaving the sub-sector all too often to everyone.

Withal anticipating irrational consumer patterns, framing up business strategies [15] and consumer policies; the application of which has also manifested to public sector policy assessment and planning - the very foundation of the British Behavioral Insights Team (aka "Nudge Units") [16] - an organization that partners with governments, authorities and businesses to grapple with major policy problems by homing in inherent human behavioral patterns.

Figures from a 2014 Report of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) spelt out up to 60 national policies had thrived on behavioral economics concepts [17]. From since, we have all too often heard of the staggering surge in the number of Swedish compatriots willing to organ-donate [18] (86%) and Austrian’s (almost 100%, akin France and Poland), whilst set side by side with other European countries - Denmark (4.2%) or the Netherlands (27.5%) - which had never set which as a default regulation for citizens (who, however, own every right to file a waiver).

On the whole those leaving "I agree to participate in organ donation" blank would as well turn down "I do not agree to participate in organ donation". After all, what seemed to get on their nerves was ticking some boxes, instead of having their organs donated. By gently swatting at those clinging to social norms, policy makers have modified the citizen behaviors of an entire country.

After all, akin Neoclassical economics or any economic theory, Behavioral economics must bear with it many a constraint [19]; yet the emergence of which has stirred up major changes in economic entities; at least getting us to more “wisely splurge”. By leaving itself open to neoclassical economics [20], behavioral economics must appear any less conducive to positive changes, through social policies.

As a rule, “bloodsoaked” forms implying criticality and urgency might fend off gimmick businesses’ feckless tax-paying habits.

Nevertheless, however auspicious it might appear, it could hardly stave off the woeful fact that behavioral maneuvers would also bear with which many a crippling burden we are yet to know.

After all, we have always been quelled, and loomed over by the “system”. The difference, however, did rarely lie in who to heed such an appalling truth.
